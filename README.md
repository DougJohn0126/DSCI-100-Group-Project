# Can we use the health report information to predict whether a patient has heart disease?
by Alan Cho, Bowen Cui, Jia Yi, Kiki

This project was done in December 2022 as a entry level data science course at UBC.

The study aimed to create a validation set to determine the number of k-nearest-neighbors that yield the most accurate predictions and perform a 5-fold cross validation on the training data. From there a model was built using the best K value and used to predict on the test dataset patients that are likely to have heart disease and those who are not.
